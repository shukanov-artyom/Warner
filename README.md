Analyzes warnings in log file generated by Bamboo build run, blames developers.

Uses SVN integration to get information about who was the last person to change a particular line in code which generated warning.
Keeps statistics in database and shows it to anyone interested.

Currently working on a WEB API and console client to report warnings from Bamboo build.
